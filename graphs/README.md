# Graph Datasets

The evaluation is based on six different datasets,
of which some of them are provided as part of this repo, 
whereas others need to be downloaded separately and placed in this folder before the evaluation can be run, as the following table lists.

| Dataset                 | Source                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Instructions                                                                                                                                  |
