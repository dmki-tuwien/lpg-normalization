# DMKI Template Repo

The README.md file is the first file users of your software will see. In order to create a good first expression on users and to ease the use of the software the README.md file should contain:

* A very short (ideally 1-2 sentences) *description* of what the software contained in the repository does.
* A *getting started* section which explains how to use the software in practice within a few easy steps (e.g., pull docker container, and run it). This should also state how tests and experiments can be repeated.
* A link to the actual in-depth *documentation* of the source code. This documentation should be based on inline comments in the code as well as extra content located in the folder [`docs`](docs) explaining details.
* A *development* section that describes how to set up a development environment in order to be able to contribute.

Use a *`.gitignore`* file to remove caches, configuration files of IDEs, or sensitive variables, such as API keys, etc.
For a tidy project structure, on the top level of the repository only a limited number of files should be located. 
Please use the folders provided:
* `src` for source code
* `docs` for documentation
* `data` for data sets

Please do not forget to fill in the placeholders at the very top of the [license file](LICENSE.txt)!

The repository and the software contained in it should have an easy to memorize name, which needs to be agreed upon with your supervisor.
